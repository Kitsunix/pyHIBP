# B101: Test for use of assert
#       (Reason: The ``assert`` keyword is used in tests.)
# B106: Test for use of hard-coded password function arguments
#       (Reason: pyhibp deals with checking passwords; it's the correct arg name)
# B303: Use of insecure MD2, MD4, MD5, or SHA1 hash function.
#       (Reason: The HIBP backend stores passwords in SHA1, and we use SHA1 to compute the partial hash which is sent to the backend.)
