v2.0.1 (2018-MM-DD)
-------------------
- **Deprecation warning**: The function `is_password_breached` has moved from `pyHIBP` to `pwnedpasswords`. A wrapper has
been left to ease transition to the new function.
- The Pwned Passwords API has been released, and as such the following new functions have been added...
- `is_password_breached` in `pwnedpasswords` now returns Integer zero (0) if a password was not breached, and an Integer
count of the number of times the password was found in the Pwned Password corpus if the password's hash was found.
- `range_search` supplies only five characters of the SHA-1 hash of a password to the Pwned Passwords server, permitting
a potentially unbreached password to remain just that: unbreached.

v2.0.0 (2018-02-01)
-------------------
- Initial release.
